# email-password-administration
An early project where I would enter a first and last name so that it would generate an email, and an autogenerated password. Then, You could change the password, display settings and even set an alt email.
This was done mostly trough the terminal. Just run the main method and type in the terminal.

To test this app, run the EmailApp.java file.
